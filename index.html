    <p>
        I am a student of <strong>Caleb University</strong>, studying <strong>Cyber Security. </strong> I am
    passionate about web development and design. I love creating beautiful and
    functional websites that provide a great user experience. In my free time,
    I enjoy sport, playing video games, and making researches on new <em>technologies

    <p class="list"><em>My Intrests are:</em>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Development</li>
            <p>Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications. It involves tasks such as designing the layout, writing code, and ensuring that websites function properly across different devices and browsers. Web development can include front-end development (what users see), back-end development (server-side logic), and full-stack development (both front-end and back-end).</p>
            <li>Cyber Security</li>
            <p>Cyber security is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. It involves implementing measures such as firewalls, encryption, and secure passwords to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data.</p>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI technologies are used in applications such as virtual assistants, image recognition, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
            <li>Machine Learning</li>
            <p>Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns, make predictions, and automate decision-making processes in applications such as recommendation systems, image recognition, and language translation.</p>
